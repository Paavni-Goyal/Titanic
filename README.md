# 🛳️ Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the famous Titanic dataset. The objective is to understand patterns and relationships within the data that influenced passenger survival. The project includes detailed visualizations, statistical summaries, and a question-answer document derived from the analysis.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `EDA_on_Titanic.ipynb` : Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step EDA  
- `Titanic_EDA_Insights.docx` : Document summarizing key questions and findings  
- `README.md` : Project overview and documentation  

## 📊 Key Objectives

- Understand the structure and content of the Titanic dataset  
- Identify and handle missing data  
- Perform univariate and bivariate analysis  
- Visualize survival rates based on various features (e.g., gender, class, age)  
- Derive actionable insights from the dataset for potential predictive modeling  

## 🔍 Insights

The analysis focuses on answering most insightful data-driven questions such as:

- What is the demographic breakdown of the passengers?  
- What factors influenced survival rates?  
- How do features like age, gender, and class interact?  
- Where did most passengers embark from?  
- Are there any noticeable correlations between variables?
